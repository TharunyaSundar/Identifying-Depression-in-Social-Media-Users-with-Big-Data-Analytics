changes made:

--> original 'mypersonality_cleaned.csv' had 2 columns 'Unnamed: 26' and 'Unnamed: 25'. we deleted that and then removed all 'na' values

--> for the following piece of code we filled all na values as 0:

	features = ['cEXT', 'cNEU', 'cOPN', 'cAGR', 'cCON']
	for feature in features:
  	status_data[feature] = status_data[feature].map({'y': 1, 'n':0}).fillna(0).astype(int)
